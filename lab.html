			<h1>Video Compression Lab</h1>
		</div>
		<hr>

		<b>EXTREMELY ROUGH WORK IN PROGRESS. Please send suggestions to video-lab@mit.edu.</b>
		<br>

		<h2>Set up</h2>
		Clone the lab and ffmpeg sources:
		<pre>$ git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg
$ git clone https://github.com/petersn/video-compression-lab</pre>
		Additionally, it is <b>highly</b> recommended that you install libsdl2 so you can build ffplay (although it isn't required to complete the lab).
		Under Ubuntu/Debian you can install libsdl2  with:
		<pre>$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev</pre>
		You will need about 1.5 GiB of free disk space to build ffmpeg.

		<p>
		As you work through the following tasks you can check your progress with the automatic grading script <tt>grading.py</tt> (Python 2 and 3 compatible) as follows:
		<pre>$ cd video-compression-lab
$ python grading.py ../ffmpeg</pre>

		You can also run a subset of the tests by specifying additional arguments:
		<pre>
$ python grading.py ../ffmpeg test_for_ffmpeg_binary test_for_labcodec_in_codecs</pre>

		Initially you should pass zero tests.

		<h2>Integrating</h2>
		<p>
		The base code for your codec is given in <tt>src/labcodec.c</tt> and <tt>src/labcodec.h</tt>.
		Where <tt>ffmpeg/</tt> is the path to your ffmpeg source, you should copy these files to <tt>ffmpeg/libavcodec/</tt>.
		You will be implementing the entirety of your codec in these files, and shouldn't need to create any additional files beyond these, although you are free to.
		From here on paths will implicitly be relative to the root of your ffmpeg source.

		<p>
		However, before we can start modifying <tt>libavcodec/labcodec.c</tt>, the first thing to do is hook up with libavcodec.
		Our encoder and decoder are represented by an <tt>AVCodec</tt> struct each, which are defined at the end of <tt>libavcodec/labcodec.c</tt>.
		These two structs should be the only exported symbols of the file, and all other functions and global variables in <tt>libavcodec/labcodec.c</tt> should be declared as static to avoid polluting or colliding with the ffmpeg namespace.
		These structs have fields like <tt>.init</tt>, <tt>.decode</tt>, and <tt>.encode2</tt> that hold pointers to the static functions that implement your codec, and libavcodec will only know about your codec via these structs.

		<p>
		You should make the following edits to libavcodec's source to integrate your file.
		<ul>
			<li>
			All codecs in libavcodec are referenced by ID numbers that come from an enum in <tt>libavcodec/avcodec.h</tt>.
			Add an entry in a reasonable place for <tt>AV_CODEC_ID_LABCODEC</tt>, which we will use as the identifier for our codec.

			<li>
			Your codec needs a description in <tt>libavcodec/codec_desc.c</tt>.
			There is a data structure there <tt>static const AVCodecDescriptor codec_descriptors[]</tt> that holds an unordered array of <tt>AVCodecDescriptors</tt>.
			Codecs are found by performing a linear search through this array, so add an entry similar to the others for your codec.
			You should set the <tt>.id</tt> to <tt>AV_CODEC_ID_LABCODEC</tt>, the <tt>.type</tt> to <tt>AVMEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO</tt>, the <tt>.name</tt> to <tt>"labcodec"</tt>, and <tt>.props</tt> to <tt>AV_CODEC_PROP_LOSSY</tt>.
			The <tt>.long_name</tt> is unimportant, but could be set to something like "Video Compression Lab Codec".

			<li>
			There is a singly-linked-list of <tt>AVCodec</tt>s that is maintained in <tt>libavcodec/utils.c</tt>.
			This is the list that is searched by <tt>libavcodec/utils.c: avcodec_find_decoder</tt> to map a codec ID number (like <tt>AV_CODEC_ID_LABCODEC</tt>) to the actual <tt>AVCodec</tt> struct that holds the all-important function pointers.
			In order to get our codec into this list, add the following two lines to <tt>libavcodec/allcodecs.c</tt> in a reasonable looking place:
			<pre>extern AVCodec ff_labcodec_encoder;
extern AVCodec ff_labcodec_decoder;</pre>
			These declarations are scrapped by <tt>configure</tt> to populate a file <tt>libavcodec/codec_list.c</tt>, and ultimately ends up adding our <tt>AVCodec</tt> structs to the global list of codecs.

			<li>
			Codecs are often identified in containers by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FourCC">FourCC</a>s, so we will add a code for our format.
			The file <tt>libav<b>format</b>/riff.c</tt> has a data structure <tt>const AVCodecTag ff_codec_bmp_tags[]</tt> that you should add the following entry to, in some reasonable place:
			<pre>{ AV_CODEC_ID_LABCODEC,     MKTAG('L', 'a', 'b', 'C') },</pre>

			<li>
			By default ffmpeg won't compile <tt>labcodec.c</tt>, so you have add it to <tt>libavcodec/Makefile</tt> with the following lines:
			<pre>OBJS-$(CONFIG_LABCODEC_ENCODER)        += labcodec.o
OBJS-$(CONFIG_LABCODEC_DECODER)        += labcodec.o</pre>
			Here <tt>CONFIG_LABCODEC_ENCODER</tt> and <tt>CONFIG_LABCODEC_DECODER</tt> are Make variables that we will handle setting in the next step.
		</ul>

		<b>Once</b> you have done the above, you can run:
		<pre>$ ./configure --enable-ffplay</pre>
		The configure script will auto-detect your new codec, and write out <tt>./config.h</tt>, which will contain <tt>CONFIG_LABCODEC_{ENCODER,DECODER}</tt> entries, globally enabling your codec.

		Once you have configured you should be able to successfully build with:
		<pre>$ make -j4</pre>
		It should take several minutes, but not more than ten.
		There is no need to <tt>make install</tt>.
		From this point on you should only need to touch <tt>labcodec.{c,h}</tt>, and remaking should only take a few seconds.

		<p>
		Once it has compiled you can check for presence of your codec with:
		<pre>$ ./ffmpeg -codecs | grep labcodec</pre>
		You should get out a line with the description you set above.

		<p>
		Code not working? Check the following.
		<ul class=hints>
			<li>
			Do you have modifications to all of the following files?
<table>
<tr><td>File</td><td># of lines added</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>libavcodec/avcodec.h</tt></td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>libavcodec/codec_desc.c</tt></td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>libavcodec/allcodecs.c</tt></td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>libavformat/riff.c</tt></td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>libavcodec/Makefile</tt></td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>
			<li>
			It's okay if you already compiled ffmpeg before making the above modifications, but if you did, did you rerun <tt>./configure --enable-ffplay</tt> before running <tt>make -j4</tt> again?
			<li>
			If everything is building successfully, but ffmpeg isn't reporting your codec as present then make sure that it is actually compiling <tt>labcodec.c</tt> in, by double checking <tt>config.h</tt>, and watching as it builds the sources in <tt>libavcodec/</tt>.
			<li>
			Are you on a system that has a version of ffmpeg preinstalled, and are you accidentally invoking that version instead?
			If so, remember to run <tt>./ffmpeg</tt>, not <tt>ffmpeg</tt>.
		</ul>

		<p class=todo>
		Make the above modifications, compile, and run the grading script.
		You should pass the first two tests.

		<h2>Making a trivial codec</h2>
		You should now take a moment to familiarize yourself with <tt>libavcodec/labcodec.c</tt> and <tt>libavcodec/labcodec.h</tt>.
		To encode a video ffmpeg will:
		<ul>
			<li>Create a <tt>LabCodecContext</tt> (defined in <tt>libavcodec/labcodec.h</tt>), and initialize it with the <tt>encode_init</tt> function.
			<li>Pass in each frame in order by calling <tt>encode_frame</tt> once per frame. The <tt>encode_frame</tt> function reads the pixels of the frame, and writes out an encoded representation.
			<li>Finally, call <tt>encode_end</tt>.
		</ul>
		Decoding is similar, but with the decode functions.

		<p>
		As a warm-up your first goal will be to write a trivial "raw" codec that accomplishes no compression, and simply encodes all 24 bits per pixel.
		This shouldn't take more than twenty additional lines of code.

		To test your code you can run:
		<pre>
$ make -j4
...
$ ./ffmpeg -y -i ../video-compression-lab/samples/sample1.mkv -vcodec labcodec output.mkv
...
$ ./ffplay output.mkv</pre> 
		Your resultant <tt>output.mkv</tt> file should be around 114 MiB in size, and should play correctly with ffplay as shown above.

		Once you have this working, you can run the grading script, which will encode and decode the sample, and compare the result to the original video.

<!--
NOTICE: I think this is actually false. It seems libavcodec masks printf, and disables it if writing to stdout is requested.
		<p class=important>
		The grading script currently relies on making ffmpeg write encoded video files to stdout, which is captured via pipes.
		Thus, if you want to put debugging print statements into your code you must either print to stderr, or comment them out before running the grading script.
-->

		<ul class=hints>
			<li>
			Use the macro <tt>PIXEL(color, x, y)</tt> to read and write the image data, and <tt>avctx-&gt;width</tt> and <tt>avctx-&gt;height</tt>  for image dimensions.
			Use the functions <tt>put_bits</tt> and <tt>get_bits</tt> in <tt>encode_frame</tt> and <tt>decode_frame</tt> respectively to write the compressed stream and read it back.

			<li>
			If you would like to use gdb run the <tt>ffmpeg_g</tt> binary instead; it is identical to <tt>ffmpeg</tt>, but also has debugging symbols.

			<li>
			You can dump the raw pixels (essentially what your codec should be outputting) from a video using:
			<pre>./ffmpeg -i video.mkv -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb24 output.raw</pre>
			Warning: This will produce very large (~100 MiB) files!
			If you are having issues it may be helpful to convert both the input sample and your encoded video to raw files, and compare the binary files.

<!--
			<li>
			If you simply want hashes of the output frames from decoding your format to see if a change makes any difference, the following may be useful:
			<pre>./ffmpeg -i output.mkv -f framecrc -</pre>

			<li>
			Are you remembering to recompile?
			The grading script won't recompile for you.
-->
		</ul>

		<p class=todo>
		Modify <tt>encode_frame</tt> and <tt>decode_frame</tt> to implement your "raw" codec, then run the grading script.
		You should pass the first five tests.

		<h2>Making a real codec</h2>
		Now that you have a functioning trivial codec, all that remains is to write the codec of your choosing.
		The last test has two parts: Firstly, you pass if you successfully compress the sample file to less than 5% of the naive raw encoding (that is, &lt; 5.7 MiB compressed size) while maintaining a PSNR of at least 35 dB across all frames.
		Secondarily, a score is printed equal to the PSNR you achieved times the compression ratio.
		Once you are passing, feel free to try to maximize this score.
		(For reference, the minimum passing score is 700, and libx264 r2721 with <tt>-preset placebo -tune psnr -crf 32</tt> achieves a score of 36097.)

		To run just this test:
		<pre>$ python grading.py ../ffmpeg test_compression</pre>

		<p>
<!--		At this point you may ignore the rest of this page and write any codec you please.
		The rest of this document outlines a simple codec recipe that will definitely pass the required tests. -->
		To pass this test you can either roll your own codec, or follow the general design in this <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petersn/video-compression-lab/blob/master/recipe.html">LabCodec recipe</a>.

		<ul class=hints>
			<li>
			You will probably want persistent data structures stored between frames (for residuals, tables, etc.).
			You can add fields to <tt>LabCodecContext</tt> in <tt>libavcodec/labcodec.h</tt> for your inter-frame storage, and allocate any needed buffers in <tt>encode_init</tt>.

			<li>
			To allocate memory use <tt>av_mallocz</tt> and <tt>av_free</tt>.

			<li>
			Don't develop blind! See what your encoded video looks like by encoding and playing back with ffplay:
			<pre>$ ./ffmpeg -y -i ../video-compression-lab/samples/sample1.mkv -vcodec labcodec output.mkv
$ ./ffplay output.mkv</pre>


			<li>
			As you work on passing test 6 you will probably start to fail test 5.
			However, technically test 5 doesn't require that your codec be completely lossless, but simply that the encoding achieve a PSNR of at least 40 dB.

			<p>
			Thus, to help you pass all the tests simultaneously the grading script passes <tt>-q:v 10</tt> to ffmpeg for test 5 and <tt>-q:v 5</tT> for test 6.
			This is a quality parameter that some ffmpeg encoders listen to for rate control &mdash; it's passed to encoders and has no intrinsic effect.
			You can access it from your encoder with:
			<pre>float quality = avctx->global_quality / (float)FF_QP2LAMBDA;</pre>
			You can choose to revert to your previous lossless behavior if <tt>quality</tt> exceeds 5, but it may be worth simply using the quality parameter in your encoding process.
			It's very likely that your codec will pass test 5 anyway if it simply responds appropriately to the quality parameter, and you calibrate 10 to be a reasonably high quality.
<!--			<li>
			TODO: Insert suggestions for a real codec.
			<li>
			Ultimately, a codec that produces single GOP consisting of an I-frame followed by P-frames that are just a complete copy of the previous frame with quantized DCT-encoded residuals (with 8x8 macroblocks) should pass the final tests.
			<li>
			A good codec for this problem won't necessarily pass test 5.
			However, you can read a quality parameter from <tt>avctx</tt>, and use it to be lower loss on test 5, you should keep passing it.
-->
		</ul>

		<p class=todo>
		Write your own video codec in <tt>labcodec.c</tt> and <tt>labcodec.h</tt> that passes the last test.
		This last test is intended to be relatively hard. Good luck.
